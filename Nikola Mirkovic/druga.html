            <p> Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, i
              n Chicago's Hermosa neighborhood.[a] He was the fourth son of E
              lias Disney‍—‌born in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents‍—‌a
              nd Flora (née Call), an American of German and English descent.
              [4][5][b] Aside from Walt, Elias and Flora's sons were Herbert, 
              Raymond and Roy; and the couple had a fifth child, Ruth, in Dec
              ember 1903.[8] In 1906, when Disney was four, the family moved 
              to a farm in Marceline, Missouri, where his uncle Robert had ju
              st purchased land. In Marceline, Disney developed his interest 
              in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neig
              hborhood doctor.[9] Elias was a subscriber to the Appeal to Reas
              on newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-
              page cartoons of Ryan Walker.[10] He also began to develop an ab
              ility to work with watercolors and crayons.[5] He lived near the
               Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line and became enamored 
               with trains.[11] He and his younger sister Ruth started school 
               at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909.[
               12] The Disney family were active members of a Congregational 
               church. </p>
